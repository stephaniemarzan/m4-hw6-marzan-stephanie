Pizza Assignment

I completed the Codeacademy Javascript course, which helped me complete this assignment. I ran into issues with the toppings section though and asked the Professor for guidance since my code was not correctly trimming the responses, considering null values or multiplying correctly based on the number of toppings. I was able to adjust my if statement to consider all of these scenarios.
